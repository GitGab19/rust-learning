This repo is focused on learning Rust through any kind of practical projects development.

## moon_weight_computation <img align="top" src="https://www.transparentpng.com/thumb/moon/vndtNa-moon-making-closest-pass-earth-since-intellihub.png" width="25" height="25">
This is the first basic project developed in Rust. It's very easy, and it does nothing else than calculating your weight onto the Moon :)

## http_server <img align="top" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/96/null/server-shutdown.png" width="30" height="30">
This is another Rust project developed following a course found on the web. <br>
It introduces a lot of fundamental concepts about Rust programming, trying to reproduce a very simple server activity.
